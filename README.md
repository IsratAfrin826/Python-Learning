### Backslash characters and comments
Data type - integer, floating point/decimal,string

Backslash character/ Escape Sequences

              \n = new line
              
              \t = tab
              
              \" = "
              
              \' = '

### Basic Numerical Operations

              +

              -

              *

              /

              //(FLOOR)

              **(EXPONENTIATION)

### Relational Operator                               Boolean Values

             >                              True                               

             >=                             False

             <

             <=

             ==

             !=

## Control Statement 

Conditional control statement (if , elif , else)

Loop control statement(for , while)

## if statement syntex

 if expression:
 
     statements

## if , else syntax

  if expression:

    statements
    
  else:

    statements

**statement 1 -> if statement**

**statement 2 -> if statement ,else statement**

**statement 3 -> if statement , elif statement...... , else statement**

**inner if statement** also called **nested if statement**

## Logical Operator 

        and    or     not

## while loop

    i= 1
    
    while i <= 10
    
    print (i)
    
    i = i + 1
    
print ("End")

### Lamda Functions

A function without name(Anonymous Function).

Not Powerful as named Function.

It can work with single expression/ single line of code.

### Recursion

Recursion is a process where a function can call itself.

To stop calling we need a base case.

**important points in case of Recursion**
1. Recursive call
2. Base case

**Recursion example**
5! = 5*4*3*2*1
4! = 4*3*2*1
3! = 3*2*1
2! = 2*1
1! = 1

n! = n * (n-1)!


int fact(int n)
{
    //base case
    if(n==1)
          return 1;
    else
          return n * fact(n-1);
